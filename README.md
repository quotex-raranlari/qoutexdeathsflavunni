## What is a Candle?

A candle is a graphical representation of the price movement of an asset
over a specific period of time. Candlesticks consist of a body and two
wicks. The body of the candle represents the difference between the
opening and closing prices, while the wicks represent the high and low
prices of the period.

Candlesticks can be used to identify trends, support and resistance
levels, and other important trading information. They are a versatile
tool that can be used by traders of all levels of experience.

## How to Use the Candle Strategy

The candle strategy is a trading strategy that uses candlesticks to
identify trading opportunities. The basic premise of the strategy is
that the color and shape of the candlesticks can provide insights into
the future direction of the market.

There are many different candle patterns that can be used to trade. Some
of the most popular patterns include:

-   Bullish engulfing pattern
-   Bearish engulfing pattern
